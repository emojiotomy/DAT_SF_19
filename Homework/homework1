Using chipotle.tsv in the data subdirectory:

    Look at the head and the tail, and think for a minute about how the data is structured. What do you think each column means? What do you think each row means? Tell me! (If you're unsure, look at more of the file contents.)

Columns represent an item descriptor, rows represent an individual item

    How many orders do there appear to be?
1834

    How many lines are in the file?
        4623 chipotle.tsv

    Which burrito is more popular, steak or chicken?
  
  Chicken

pressure% awk '{print $3, $4, $5}' chipotle.tsv | awk -F"[" '{print $1}'| sort |uniq -c|grep -i burrito
  91 Barbacoa Burrito
   6 Burrito
  59 Carnitas Burrito
 553 Chicken Burrito
 368 Steak Burrito
  95 Veggie Burrito


    Do chicken burritos more often have black beans or pinto beans?

black beans are more common
pressure% grep -i "chicken burrito" chipotle.tsv |grep -i black |wc -l
     282
pressure% grep -i "chicken burrito" chipotle.tsv |grep -i pinto |wc -l
     105

     Make a list of all of the CSV or TSV files in the DAT7 repo (using a single command). Think about how wildcard characters can help you with this task.

     pressure% find /Users/ml/code/DAT_SF_19 -name "*.*sv"
/Users/ml/code/DAT_SF_19/data/airlines.csv
/Users/ml/code/DAT_SF_19/data/chipotle.tsv
/Users/ml/code/DAT_SF_19/data/drinks.csv
/Users/ml/code/DAT_SF_19/data/hitters.csv
/Users/ml/code/DAT_SF_19/data/imdb_1000.csv
/Users/ml/code/DAT_SF_19/data/titanic.csv
/Users/ml/code/DAT_SF_19/data/ufo.csv

/Users/ml/code/DAT_SF_19/data/vehicles_train.csv
/Users/ml/code/DAT_SF_19/data/yelp.csv


Count the number of occurrences of the word 'dictionary' (regardless of case) across all files in the DAT7 repo.

pressure% grep -io '\<dictionary\>' */*|wc -w
grep: project/project-examples: Is a directory
       5
pressure% grep -io '\<dictionary\>' project/project-examples/*|wc -w
       0


Optional: Use the the command line to discover something "interesting" about the Chipotle data. The advanced commands below may be helpful to you!

Looks like there's a single occurrence of Chips at 1.99, typically they cost 1.69 as a side or 2.15 on their own.

pressure% grep -i chips chipotle.tsv|egrep -v Guaca|egrep -v and|awk -F'NULL' '{print$2}'|sort |uniq -c
  99 	$1.69
   1 	$1.99
   1 	$13.52
 192 	$2.15
  17 	$4.30
   1 	$5.07
   1 	$6.45


pressure% grep '$1.99' chipotle.tsv
1793	1	Chips	NULL	$1.99
